                <h2>Why should you visit Budapest in addition to the Korfball Tournament?</h2>
                    <p>Hungary has an area of about 93,000 square kilometers and almost 10 million inhabitants. Since 2004 he has been a member of the European Union.</p>
                    <p>In a relatively small area of Hungary it carries many natural beauties; beautiful rivers, nice mountains, velvety lakes, green forests, spacious terrains, cavernous underground worlds, and the second largest thermal lake in the world. The beautiful natural surroundings provide great opportunities for hiking and other outdoor activities. As a result of this, Hungary is becoming an increasingly popular tourist destination in Europe, where more than 12 million visitors arrive each year - currently the 23rd most visited country in the world. The visitors are an enduring experience of the famous dessert wines of the Tokaj region, which are also called the "king of wines and the wine of the kings". The Hévízi lake at 25 ° C is Europe's largest healing hot water lake, and Hungary is also abundant in thermal waters: our country has the world's 5th largest thermal water pool, where there are 1300 thermal springs and 83 qualified spas. Although the country does not have a beach, it is also known as the "Hungarian Sea", which is the largest standing water in Central Europe. The 70-kilometer long greenish-blue lake, which is particularly pleasant, is the most popular resort in Hungary.</p>

            <p>The International Korfball Federation has extended the contract with its CEO Tilbert La Haye. La Haye, a Dutch national, joined the IKF in 2016. He has headed the IKF operations since then with great success. Under his leadership, the professionalism in day-to-day operations has increased substantially. Furthermore, he has taken new initiatives such as the IKF Beach Korfball World Cup series, and programs to develop the administration and playing strength of the many young national organizations that have joined the IKF in the past decade.</p>
                    <p>Tilbert La Haye: “I am very proud of the confidence the IKF shows by extending my contract for the years to come. We have been making major steps forward with our intensified international competition calendar – particularly in youth –  and the development of the IKF Beach Korfball World Cup series, with events upcoming in Belgium, Hong Kong and China. This is a good foundation for extending our marketing and sponsorship proposition, which we are currently aligning with our unique gender-equality requirement in every single korfball match played wherever.”
