                <h1>Hungary</h1>
                <p>Hungary is a medium-sized country in the Carpathian basin, with ten million inhabitants. It has been a member state of the European Union since 2004. The size of the country is about 93 000 square kilometres, its official language is Hungarian. Hungary is proudly placed 8th in the all-time Olympic medal table.<br/>
                    Although Hungary is humble in size, throughout history it has welcomed and given home to diverse values, cultures and traditions – and is part of both the Eastern and Western heritage. It has given the world many well-known inventors, scientists, explorers, composers and athletes. In addition Hungary has more Nobel Prize winners per capita than any other nation.<br/>
                    Besides being a world leader in Nobel Prize laureates, there are also many famous inventions and innovations that Hungarians have given to the world - just to name a few: the matches (János Irinyi), the dynamo and the soda water machine (Ányos Jedlik), the ballpoint pen (László Bíró) and the concept of digital computing (János von Neumann).<br/>
                    Across the country there are 8 World Heritage Sites, and even though it is a small country Hungary is abundant in natural beauty such as 10 national parks, rivers, gentle hills, fresh water lakes, lush forests, large plains, caves and caverns with fantastic underground treasures and the world’s second largest thermal lake. The capital city Budapest and the countryside both evoke a strong sense of history and tradition almost at every turn. In Hungary many cities have attained their historical monuments, showing influence from various cultures, including the Turkish invaders, Austrian emperors, not to mention Italian Renaissance designers. All this makes the country an increasingly popular European tourist destination. Currently, with over 12 million visitors, Hungary ranks as the 23rd most visited country in the world.<br/>
                    Some of the real treasures of the country are: The Northernmost historical mosque of the continent can be found in the city of Pécs and the nearby town of Villány produces one of the best red wines in Hungary. With its scenic setting and beautiful old houses Hollókő is a village where the traditional way of life is still alive. Esztergom, a charming little town with an imposing Basilica is the spiritual home and first capital of Hungary and Aggtelek offers the unique adventure of visiting the largest cave system in Central Europe. The Tokaj region’s  gift to the world is the locally produced dessert wine, which is known as the “wine of kings and king of wines”. Although Hungary is a landlocked country, Lake Balaton, central Europe&#39;s largest fresh water lake, is often called the Hungarian sea. The more than 70-kilometre long lake with its silky bluish green water is one of Hungary’s most frequented resorts.<br/>

                <h1>Budapest</h1>
                <p>
                    Budapest is the capital and the largest city of Hungary, a metropolis which leaves the visitor thirsting for more. This impressive capital has the very best of what Hungary has to offer. It is a large, vibrant city, with a population of approximately 2 million people. Being one of the most densely populated cities in the region, it is not just the powerhouse of the Hungarian economy, but also an important cultural centre and the focus of the country’s political life.<br/>
                    The history of the city began with Aquincum, originally a Celtic settlement that became the Roman capital of Lower Pannonia. Hungarians arrived to the territory in the 9th century. Budapest became a single city occupying both banks of the Danube River with the unification of Pest, Buda and Óbuda in 1873.<br/>
                    Today Budapest is a popular tourist destination in Europe. Even if only for a short stay, there are many things worth seeing in Budapest. It has the largest thermal water system in the world, the first underground of European was built in Budapest more than a 120 years ago, and the Hungarian capital has the third largest Parliament building in the world, as well as the biggest and one of the most spectacular synagogues in Europe.<br/>
                    The Buda Castle Hill, with the 700-year-old Matthias Church, the Royal Palace and the Fishermen&#39;s Bastion, is among the most fascinating World Heritage Sites, with spectacular views to the downtown and the Danube River, with her many bridges, amongst them the beautiful Chain Bridge – the first one to permanently connect Buda and Pest.<br/>
                    The Opera House, was opened in 1884 during the Austro-Hungarian Empire, attracts not only the music lovers, but also those who want to admire its architectural beauty. The Opera is located on Andrássy Avenue, often called Budapest&#39;s Champs-Elysées, leading on to Heroes Square, built in 1896 to mark the thousandth anniversary of the Hungarian state. The City Park is just a couple of steps away – with Vajdahunyad Castle, a replica of a Transylvanian castle of that name, the Budapest Zoo and many museums.<br/>
